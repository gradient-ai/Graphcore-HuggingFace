    "## Optimum-Graphcore\n",
    "\n",
    "🤗 Optimum Graphcore is the interface between the 🤗 Transformers library and [Graphcore IPUs](https://www.graphcore.ai/products/ipu).\n",
    "It provides a set of tools enabling model parallelization and loading on IPUs, training and fine-tuning on all the tasks already supported by Transformers while being compatible with the Hugging Face Hub and every model available on it out of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "🤗 Optimum Graphcore was designed with one goal in mind: make training and evaluation straightforward for any 🤗 Transformers user while leveraging the complete power of IPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an Intelligence Processing Unit (IPU)?\n",
    "Quote from the Hugging Face [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/graphcore#what-is-an-intelligence-processing-unit):\n",
    ">IPUs are the processors that power Graphcore’s IPU-POD datacenter compute systems. This new type of processor is designed to support the very specific computational requirements of AI and machine learning. Characteristics such as fine-grained parallelism, low precision arithmetic, and the ability to handle sparsity have been built into our silicon.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Instead of adopting a SIMD/SIMT architecture like GPUs, Graphcore’s IPU uses a massively parallel, MIMD architecture, with ultra-high bandwidth memory placed adjacent to the processor cores, right on the silicon die.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This design delivers high performance and new levels of efficiency, whether running today’s most popular models, such as BERT and EfficientNet, or exploring next-generation AI applications.\n",

    "\n",
    "The model layers are split over 8 IPUs. We then use [*pipeline parallelism*](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/tf-model-parallelism/en/latest/pipelining.html) over the IPUs with gradient accumulation. We subdivide the compute batch into micro-batches that pass through the pipeline in the forward pass and then come back again in the backwards pass, accumulating gradients for the parameters as they go.\n",
    "\n",
    "A complete pipeline step has a ramp-up phase the start and a ramp-down phase at the end. Increasing the gradient accumulation factor, increases the total batch size and also increases the pipeline efficiency, and therefore throughput, because the proportion of time in ramp-up/down phases will be reduced. \n",

The position and word embeddings, and the first 3 encoder layers will sit on IPU0, the following 3 IPUs have 7 transformer layers each. This partition is specified in the `IPUConfig` by the `layers_per_ipu` parameter.\n",

    "### Data Parallelism\n",
    "\n",
    "An IPU-POD16 contains 16 IPUs and our pipeline is 4 IPUs long. We can therefore replicate the pipeline, feeding four different micro-batches to the device, which multiplies the effective mini-batch size by four. We call this configuration a \"4x4 pipeline\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recomputation Checkpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "We can make more efficient use of the valuable In-Processor-Memory by saving only selected activation inputs and recomputing the rest. This lets us optimise on memory savings (by not storing all activations) vs FLOP expenditure (by not having to recompute all activations). \n",
